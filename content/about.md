### Hi! I'm a Full-Stack developer originally from Dallas, Texas! I am currently living in Seattle, Washington.

{{< figure src="/assets/Belle.jpg" title="Me and my little girl Belle on the way back from swimming" >}}

I've been fascinated by technology and computers since I got my first PC to share with my brother and sister. I currently work mostly in front-end web development and specialize in JavaScript and some of it's associated libraries like Node and Angular, as well as effective templating tools like TypeScript.

When I'm not spending time with my Golden Retriever Belle, I enjoy making music, playing sports, and watching movies or tv shows. I am constantly trying to find where code can intersect with these interests and create a deeper appreciation for them.

If you'd like to get in touch, [email me](mailto:SMontague29@gmail.com) or, for a faster but possibly less thoughtful response, hit me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/SMontague29).
