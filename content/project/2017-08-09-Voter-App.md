This was a project I helped build with some colleagues in my Bootcamp. I took the lead on the JavaScript file and also contributed a small amount of time to building the necessary HTML.

I have a working example of this app located <a href="https://smontague29.github.io/voterApp/" target="_blank">here</a>.
