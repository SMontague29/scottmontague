      <description>This was a project I helped build with some colleagues in my Bootcamp. I took the lead on the JavaScript file and also contributed a small amount of time to building the necessary HTML.
I have a working example of this app located here.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m a Full-Stack developer originally from Dallas, Texas! I am currently living in Seattle, Washington.   Me and my little girl Belle on the way back from swimming   I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by technology and computers since I got my first PC to share with my brother and sister. Currently I mostly do front-end web development and specialize in JavaScript and some of it&amp;rsquo;s associated libraries like Node and Angular.</description>
