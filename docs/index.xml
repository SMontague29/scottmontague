      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m a Full-Stack developer originally from Dallas, Texas! I am currently living in Seattle, Washington.   Me and my little girl Belle on the way back from swimming   I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by technology and computers since I got my first PC to share with my brother and sister. I currently work mostly in front-end web development and specialize in JavaScript and some of it&amp;rsquo;s associated libraries like Node and Angular, as well as effective templating tools like TypeScript.</description>
